    Enter a valid number of purchase(how many of that item you would like to buy)
        if you enter too large of a quantity, the application will alert you and allow you to enter again

## Step 3
    (VIEWME/Validate)
    Validate that you actually want to buy x of x item for x dollars
        (app will show you all that info so you have a visual)

## Step 4

    If you accept the purchase the purchase will be validated and completed, and it will allow you to begin another purchase
    However if you decline the purchase, it will not complete the purchase, but send you back and allow you to start another purchase if you so desire
